# Overview

Welcome to the 2026 Kaggle Playground Series! We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting and approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

**Your Goal:** Predict students' test scores.

---

# Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** between the predicted and the observed target.

# Submission File

For each `id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for the `exam_score` variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
| id      | exam_score |
|---------|------------|
| 630000  | 97.5       |
| 630001  | 89.2       |
| 630002  | 85.5       |
